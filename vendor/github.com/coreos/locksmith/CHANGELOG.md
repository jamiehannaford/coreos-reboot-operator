### v0.4.1

Locksmith no longer requires update-engine.service and does not have an
ordering dependency on user-config.target and system-config.target due to the
dependency loop when using coreos-cloudinit.

### v0.4.0

Locksmith now uses github.com/coreos/etcd/client, instead of the deprecated
github.com/coreos/go-etcd.

Locksmith now uses github.com/coreos/pkg/capnslog for logging.

The reboot strategy `best-effort` is deprecated, and locksmithd will complain
loudly if it is used. Please use an explicit `reboot` or `etcd-lock` strategy
instead.

Locksmith logs some information about the configured reboot window.

Locksmith supports etcd basic auth.

Locksmith again requires update-engine.service, and will start after
user-config.target system-config.target are reached.

### v0.3.4

The environment variables controlling reboot windows (`REBOOT_WINDOW_START`,
`REBOOT_WINDOW_LENGTH`) have been renamed to include the prefix `LOCKSMITHD_`
to maintain consistency with other locksmithd environment variables.

The old environment variables are still read to maintain compatibility with
locksmithd v0.3.1 to v0.3.3.

### v0.3.3

Remove dependency on update-engine.service from locksmithd.service. If
update-engine failed to start, systemd wouldn't start locksmith and the restart
logic only applies if the service can be started.

### v0.3.2

Set GOMAXPROCS=1 in the locksmithd systemd service to keep behavior consistent between builds using Go 1.5 and previous versions.

### v0.3.1

v0.3.1 is the first release with a changelog :-)

There are also a number of new features in this release, including [groups](README.md#groups), an [`off` strategy](README.md#configuration), and [reboot windows](README.md#reboot-windows).
